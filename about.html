      <h2>What is Mental Health AI Chatbots?</h2>
      <p>
        Mental health Al chatbots represent a revolutionary approach to making mental health support more 
        accessible, affordable, and available 24/7. These intelligent platforms use artificial intelligence, natural 
        language processing, and evidence-based therapeutic techniques to provide emotional support and 
        mental health resources to millions of people worldwide.
      </p>
      <p>
        While they are not replacements for professional mental health care, Al chatbots serve as valuable tools for 
        daily emotional support, mood tracking, stress management, and learning coping strategies. They can help 
        bridge the gap between therapy sessions, provide immediate support during difficult moments, and make 
        mental health resources more accessible to those who might not otherwise seek help.

        <h2>Common Mental Health Concerns Students Seek Mental Health Support For</h2>

        <h3>Stress</h3>
        <p>
          King and Marks (2024) defined stress as a physical and emotional response to demands
          or pressure. Stress becomes unhealthy when it feels constant and overwhelming.
        </p>

        <h3>Anxiety</h3>
        <p>
          Persistent worry or fear that affects daily life. According to Mayo Clinic (2025),
          it may include restlessness, overthinking, or physical symptoms like a racing heart.
        </p>

        <h3>Depression</h3>
        <p>
          More than sadness. It includes lasting low mood, loss of interest, tiredness,
          changes in sleep or appetite, and feeling hopeless.
        </p>

        <h3>Burnout</h3>
        <p>
          Emotional and physical exhaustion caused by long-term stress, common among students
          and workers who feel overwhelmed or drained.

        <h2>Why Early Support Matters</h2>
        <p>
          Early support helps prevent concerns from growing, strengthens emotional resilience,
          and makes everyday challenges easier to manage. Tools like journaling, grounding
          exercises, and mental health chatbots can offer meaningful comfort.
        </p>
        <p>
          Chatbots are especially valuable because they provide immediate, judgment-free
          support at any time, giving people a safe space to understand their feelings and
          take the first step toward care.
